It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today.

I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! **I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt.** \*_catches himself_ And that is not how I'm introducing myself.\* You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas?

I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. _catches himself_ And that is not how I'm introducing myself.

2. You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas?

Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!

- Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush.
- They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens!

It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.

Saving the world with meals on wheels. You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. _catches himself_ And that is not how I'm introducing myself.

I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in.

Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.

No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister. Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?

# Inflammable means flammable? What a country.

Dad didn't leave… When he comes back from the store, he's going to wave those pop-tarts right in your face! Get ready, skanks! It's time for the truth train! Dad didn't leave… When he comes back from the store, he's going to wave those pop-tarts right in your face!

I've had it with this school, Skinner. **Low test scores, class after class of ugly, ugly children… Look out, Itchy!** _He's Irish!_ Your questions have become more redundant and annoying than the last three "Highlander" movies.

## Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I work, I work.

Shoplifting is a victimless crime. Like punching someone in the dark. Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It's what separates us from the animals…except the weasel. I've done everything the Bible says — even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff!

1. …And the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night.
2. Save me, Jeebus.
3. Oh, a _sarcasm_ detector. Oh, that's a _really_ useful invention!

### Your guilty consciences may make you vote Democratic, but secretly you all yearn for a Republican president to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king!

The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity… Fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug were the drugs. I'm allergic to bee stings. They cause me to, uh, die. I'm normally not a praying man, but if you're up there, please save me, Superman.

- Last night's "Itchy and Scratchy Show" was, without a doubt, the worst episode _ever._ Rest assured, I was on the Internet within minutes, registering my disgust throughout the world.
- He didn't give you gay, did he? Did he?!
- Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use.

Facts are meaningless. You could use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true! They only come out in the night. Or in this case, the day. Can't you people take the law into your own hands? I mean, we can't be policing the entire city!

Aaah! Natural light! Get it off me! Get it off me! Save me, Jeebus. Oh, everything looks bad if you remember it. Me fail English? That's unpossible. I've had it with this school, Skinner. Low test scores, class after class of ugly, ugly children…

Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair city! He is the cancer and I am the…uh…what cures cancer? Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use.

Slow down, Bart! My legs don't know how to be as long as yours. I don't like being outdoors, Smithers. For one thing, there's too many fat children. Inflammable means flammable? What a country. How is education supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home winemaking course, and I forgot how to drive?

This is the greatest case of false advertising I've seen since I sued the movie "The Never Ending Story." Stan Lee never left. I'm afraid his mind is no longer in mint condition. Slow down, Bart! My legs don't know how to be as long as yours.

Please do not offer my god a peanut. Beer. Now there's a temporary solution. Oh, I'm in no condition to drive. Wait a minute. I don't have to listen to myself. I'm drunk. I'm allergic to bee stings. They cause me to, uh, die.

Here's to alcohol, the cause of — and solution to — all life's problems. Can't you people take the law into your own hands? I mean, we can't be policing the entire city! Son, a woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you'd step over your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You wanna drink another woman!

Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone. Mrs. Krabappel and Principal Skinner were in the closet making babies and I saw one of the babies and then the baby looked at me. Don't kid yourself, Jimmy. If a cow ever got the chance, he'd eat you and everyone you care about!

I'm going to the back seat of my car, with the woman I love, and I won't be back for ten minutes! He didn't give you gay, did he? Did he?! And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker. You know, the one with all the well meaning rules that don't work out in real life, uh, Christianity.

Attempted murder? Now honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel Prize for attempted chemistry? I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency. Look out, Itchy! He's Irish! I hope this has taught you kids a lesson: kids never learn.

"Thank the Lord"? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these walls, just like facts don't have a place within an organized religion. Books are useless! I only ever read one book, "To Kill A Mockingbird," and it gave me absolutely no insight on how to kill mockingbirds! Sure it taught me not to judge a man by the color of his skin…but what good does _that_ do me?
